This app made for learning purpose. At this moment Iâ€˜m learning React basics: router, hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef), uuid (for unicall id nummbers), local storage. In this 'todo' app I use
'is complete' function (please press text for check/uncheck 'todo' row). 


After opening the project, don't forget to run  'npm install'.
